Icinga replication scripts

There are three scripts and an two example icinga configs: 

-master-icinga.cfg is a host and service definition that is used on the slave instance. If the master goes down it will enable notifications
-slave-icinga.cfg is a host, servie, and command definitiuon that is used on the master instance. This checks to see if icinga is running on the slave and checks the icinga replication. 

-replicate_icinga.sh does the actual replication and runs on the master server using rsync.
-restart_icinga.cgi is called by the replication script and runs under the webserver running icinga (ie apache) on the slave. It checks the sanity of the icinga config and if things are okay it will restart icinga. 
-check_icinga_replication.pl check to see the status of the replication and runs on the slave. 

You will need curl installed on the master icinga server.
